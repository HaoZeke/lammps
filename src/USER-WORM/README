This package provides the pair_style worm command. This pair style
is an experimental improvised mie potential. The goal is to provide better bulk predictions without too many trade-offs in terms of computational cost.

See lib/worm/README for more information on how to build LAMMPS
with this package.

See examples/USER/worm for several test examples that run WORM
potentials.
